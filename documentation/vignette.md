## Getting Started

You can launch the app directly from R using:

```r
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub("AssociationExplorer", "AntoineSoetewey")
```

You will need the `shiny` package and an active internet connection. A fully web-based version will be made publicly available as part of the ODALON project.
